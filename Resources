1) https://jacobian.org/writing/getting-started-with-pytest/ - basics of Pytest, using very simple example. Also has an example
for using parametrize decorator in Pytest. Good for brush up, or even the one doing it for the first time.

2) https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/parametrize.html#pytest-mark-parametrize-parametrizing-test-functions - Official doc 
for Pytest explains with small example.

3) https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/goodpractices.html#test-discovery - some good practices to keep in mind while writing
